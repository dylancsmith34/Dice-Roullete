# Dice Roullete Game
This is a simple dice roll game against an enemy

Who ever gets the highest dice roll wins the round, if the user wins the most rounds out of 10 turns they win, if not the enemy wins

If the amount of rounds won by both players is the same out of 10 rounds, there is a SUDDEN DEATH game mode. You will face the enemy in a best of 3 rounds game mode, whoever wins the most out of 3 rounds, is the winner.
